SQL - UNIONS CLAUSE
---------------------
The SQL UNION clause/operator is used to combine the results of two or more 
SELECT statements without returning any duplicate rows.

To use this UNION clause, each SELECT statement must have

The same number of columns selected
The same number of column expressions
The same data type and
Have them in the same order
But they need not have to be in the same length.

SQL> SELECT  ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATE
   FROM CUSTOMERS
   LEFT JOIN ORDERS
   ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID
UNION
   SELECT  ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATE
   FROM CUSTOMERS
   RIGHT JOIN ORDERS
   ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID;

The UNION ALL Clause
-------------------
The UNION ALL operator is used to combine the results of two SELECT 
statements including duplicate rows.

The same rules that apply to the UNION clause will apply to the UNION ALL operator.

SQL> SELECT  ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATE
   FROM CUSTOMERS
   LEFT JOIN ORDERS
   ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID
UNION ALL
   SELECT  ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATE
   FROM CUSTOMERS
   RIGHT JOIN ORDERS
   ON CUSTOMERS.ID = ORDERS.CUSTOMER_ID;
