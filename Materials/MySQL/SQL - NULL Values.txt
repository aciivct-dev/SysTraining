SQL - NULL Values
-------------------
The SQL NULL is the term used to represent a missing value.
A NULL value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank.

A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. 
It is very important to understand that a NULL value is different than a zero
 value or a field that contains spaces.
