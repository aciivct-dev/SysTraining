SQL-JOINS
-------------
The SQL Joins clause is used to combine records from two or more tables in a database.
A JOIN is a means for combining fields from two tables by using values common to each.

 join is performed in the WHERE clause. Several operators can be used to join tables,
 such as =, <, >, <>, <=, >=, !=, BETWEEN, LIKE, and NOT; they can all be used to join tables. 
However, the most common operator is the equal to symbol.

Inner Join
--------------
The most important and frequently used of the joins is the INNER JOIN.
They are also referred to as an EQUIJOIN.

The INNER JOIN creates a new result table by combining column 
values of two tables (table1 and table2) based upon the join-predicate.
The query compares each row of table1 with each row of table2 to find
all pairs of rows which satisfy the join-predicate. When the join-predicate 
is satisfied, column values for each matched pair of rows of 
A and B are combined into a result row.

left join
------------
The SQL LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table, 
even if there are no matches in the right table. 
This means that if the ON clause matches 0 (zero) records in the right table; 
the join will still return a row in the result, but with NULL in each column from the right table.

This means that a left join returns all the values from the left table, 
plus matched values from the right table or NULL in case of no matching join predicate.

Right Join
---------------
The SQL RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table,
 even if there are no matches in the left table. 
This means that if the ON clause matches 0 (zero) records in the left table; 
the join will still return a row in the result, but with NULL in each column from the left table.

This means that a right join returns all the values from the right table,
plus matched values from the left table or NULL in case of no matching join predicate.

SQL - FULL JOINS
-------------------
The SQL FULL JOIN combines the results of both left and right outer joins.

The joined table will contain all records from both the tables and fill
in NULLs for missing matches on either side.

SQL-Self Joins
--------------
The SQL SELF JOIN is used to join a table to itself as if the table were two tables;
temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.

SQL> SELECT  a.ID, b.NAME, a.SALARY
   FROM CUSTOMERS a, CUSTOMERS b
   WHERE a.SALARY < b.SALARY;

SQL - CARTESIAN or CROSS JOINS
---------------------------------
The CARTESIAN JOIN or CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product 
of the sets of records from two or more joined tables. 
Thus, it equates to an inner join where the join-condition
always evaluates to either True or where the join-condition is absent from the statement.

 SELECT  ID, NAME, AMOUNT, DATE
   FROM CUSTOMERS, ORDERS;
