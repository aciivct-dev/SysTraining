CSS Opacity
The CSS opacity property is used to specify the transparency of an element.
In simple word, you can say that it specifies the clarity of the image.

html>  
<head>  
<style>  
img.trans {  
    opacity: 0.4;  
    filter: alpha(opacity=40); /* For IE8 and earlier */  
}  
</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
<p>Normal Image</p>  
<img src="rose.jpg" alt="normal rose">  
<p>Transparent Image</p>  
<img class="trans" src="rose.jpg" alt="transparent rose">  
</body>  
</html>  
===========================================

CSS Padding
CSS Padding property is used to define the space between the element content and the element border.

It is different from CSS margin in the way that CSS margin defines the space around elements. CSS padding is affected by the background colors. It clears an area around the content.

Top, bottom, left and right padding can be changed independently using separate properties. You can also change all properties at once by using shorthand padding property.

padding	It is used to set all the padding properties in one declaration.
padding-left	It is used to set left padding of an element.
padding-right	It is used to set right padding of an element.
padding-top	It is used to set top padding of an element.
padding-bottom	It is used to set bottom padding of an element.

<html>  
<head>  
<style>  
p {  
    background-color: pink;  
}  
p.padding {  
    padding-top: 50px;  
    padding-right: 100px;  
    padding-bottom: 150px;  
    padding-left: 200px;  
}  
</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
<p>This is a paragraph with no specified padding.</p>  
<p class="padding">This is a paragraph with specified paddings.</p>  
</body>  
</html>  

===================================================================
CSS Position
The CSS position property is used to set position for an element. it is also used to place an element behind another and also useful for scripted animation effect.

You can position an element using the top, bottom, left and right properties. These properties can be used only after position property is set first. A position element's computed position property is relative, absolute, fixed or sticky.

Let's have a look at following CSS positioning:

CSS Static Positioning
CSS Fixed Positioning
CSS Relative Positioning
CSS Absolute Positioning

1) CSS Static Positioning
This is a by default position for HTML elements. It always positions an element according to the normal flow of the page. It is not affected by the top, bottom, left and right properties.

2) CSS Fixed Positioning
The fixed positioning property helps to put the text fixed on the browser. This fixed test is positioned relative to the browser window, and doesn't move even you scroll the window.

3) CSS Relative Positioning
The relative positioning property is used to set the element relative to its normal position.

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<style>  
h2.pos_left {  
    position: relative;  
    left: -30px;  
}  
h2.pos_right {  
    position: relative;  
    left: 30px;  
}  
</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
<h2>This is a heading with no position</h2>  
<h2 class="pos_left">This heading is positioned left according to its normal position</h2>  
<h2 class="pos_right">This heading is positioned right according to its normal position</h2>  
<p>The style "left:-30px" subtracts 30 pixels from the element's original left position.</p>  
<p>The style "left:30px" adds 30 pixels to the element's original left position.</p>  
</body>  
</html>  

4) CSS Absolute Positioning
The absolute positioning is used to position an element relative to the first parent element that has a position other than static. If no such element is found, the containing block is HTML.

With the absolute positioning, you can place an element anywhere on a page.

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<style>  
h2 {  
    position: absolute;  
    left: 150px;  
    top: 250px;  
}  
</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
<h2>This heading has an absolute position</h2>  
<p> The heading below is placed 150px from the left and 250px from the top of the page.</p>  
</body>  
</html>  

=================================
CSS Outline
CSS outline is just like CSS border property. It facilitates you to draw an extra border around an element to get visual attention.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<style type="text/css">
.box {
        background-color: #eee;
        outline: 5px solid red;
        border: 9px solid lightgreen;
        padding: 15px 31px;
}
</style>
<div class="box">Welcome to css</div>
</body>
</html>

 


===================

<html>  
<style type="text/css">  
.box {  
        outline-color: red;  
        outline-width: 4px;  
        margin: 10px;  
        float: left;  
        border: 2px solid lightgreen;  
        padding: 5px 10px;  
}  
</style>  
<div class="box" style="outline-style: dashed;">This is dashed outline.</div>

<div class="box" style="outline-style: ridge;">This is ridge outline.</div>  
<div class="box" style="outline-style: solid;">This is solid outline.</div>  
</body>  
</html>  

=================================================
<html>  
<head>  
<style>  
p.pos_fixed {  
    position: fixed;  
    top: 50px;  
    right: 400px;  
    color: blue;  
}  
</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
  
<p>Some text...</p><p>Some text...</p><p>Some text...</p><p>........</p><p>.... ...</p

    button {  
           color:lightgoldenrodyellow;  
            font-size: 30px;

CSS hover
The :hover selector is for selecting the elements when we move the mouse on them. It is not only limited to the links. We can use it on almost every HTML element. To style the link to unvisited pages, we can use the :link selector. To style the link for visited pages, we can use the :visited selector and to style the active links we can use the :active selector.

Text overlay on image hover

This CSS code displays the text on the image during mouse hover. Let's see the image overlay effect during mouse hover.

<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">  
<style>  
   body{  
      text-align:center;  
   }  
* {box-sizing: border-box;}  
  
.container {  
  position: relative;  
  width: 50%;  
  max-width: 300px;  
}  
  
.image {  
  display: block;  
  width: 100%;  
  height: auto;  
}  
  
.overlay {  
  position: absolute;   
  bottom: 0;   
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);   
  width: 100%;  
  opacity:0;   
  transition: .9s ease;  
  font-size: 25px;  
  padding: 20px;  
}  
  
.container:hover .overlay {  
  opacity: 1.5;  
}  
</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
  
<h1>Image Overlay Title Effect</h1>  
<h2>Move your mouse over the image to see the effect.</h2>  
  
<center>  
<div class="container">  
      <img src="jtp.png" class="image">  
      <div class="overlay">Welcome to phoeniix.com</div>  
</div> </center>  
  
  
</body>  
</html>  

CSS filter
CSS filters are used to set visual effects to text, images, and other aspects of a webpage. The CSS filter property allows us to access the effects such as color or blur, shifting on the rendering of an element before the element gets displayed.

Syntax

filter: none | invert() | drop-shadow() | brightness() | saturate() | blur() | hue-rotate() | contrast() | opacity() | grayscale() | sepia() | url();  

brightness()
As its name implies, it is used to set the brightness of an element. If the brightness is 0%, then it represents completely black, whereas 100% brightness represents the original one. It can also accept values above 100% that provide brighter results.

CSS Images
Images are an important part of any web application. Including a lot of images in a web application is generally not recommended, but it is important to use the images wherever they required. CSS helps us to control the display of images in web applications.

The styling of an image in CSS is similar to the styling of an element by using the borders and margins. There are multiple CSS properties such as border property, height property, width property, etc. that helps us to style an image.

CSS Overflow
The CSS overflow property specifies how to handle the content when it overflows its block level container.


CSS Overflow property values
Value	Description
visible	It specifies that overflow is not clipped. it renders outside the element's box.this is a default value.
hidden	It specifies that the overflow is clipped, and rest of the content will be invisible.
scroll	It specifies that the overflow is clipped, and a scroll bar is used to see the rest of the content.
auto	It specifies that if overflow is clipped, a scroll bar is needed to see the rest of the content.
inherit	It inherits the property from its parent element.
initial	It is used to set the property to its initial value.

<style>  
div.scroll {  
    background-color: #00ffff;  
    width: 100px;  
    height: 100px;  
    overflow: scroll;  
}  

<div class="scroll">You can use the overflow property when you want to have better control of the layout.  
 The default value is visible.</div> 

CSS Position
The CSS position property is used to set position for an element. it is also used to place an element behind another and also useful for scripted animation effect.

You can position an element using the top, bottom, left and right properties. These properties can be used only after position property is set first. A position element's computed position property is relative, absolute, fixed or sticky.

Let's have a look at following CSS positioning:

CSS Static Positioning
CSS Fixed Positioning
CSS Relative Positioning
CSS Absolute Positioning

<html>  
<head>  
<style>  
h2 {  
    position: absolute;  
    left: 150px;  
    top: 250px;  
}  
</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
<h2>This heading has an absolute position</h2>  
<p> The heading below is placed 150px from the left and 250px from the top of the page.</p>  
</body>  
</html>
