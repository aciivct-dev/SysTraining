HTML5 - Overview

HTML5 is the next major revision of the HTML standard superseding HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, and XHTML 1.1. HTML5 is a standard for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.

New Features
HTML5 introduces a number of new elements and attributes that can help you in building modern websites. Here is a set of some of the most prominent features introduced in HTML5.

New Semantic Elements − These are like <header>, <footer>, and <section>.

Forms 2.0 − Improvements to HTML web forms where new attributes have been introduced for <input> tag.

Persistent Local Storage − To achieve without resorting to third-party plugins.

WebSocket − A next-generation bidirectional communication technology for web applications.

Server-Sent Events − HTML5 introduces events which flow from web server to the web browsers and they are called Server-Sent Events (SSE).

Canvas − This supports a two-dimensional drawing surface that you can program with JavaScript.

Audio & Video − You can embed audio or video on your webpages without resorting to third-party plugins.

Geolocation − Now visitors can choose to share their physical location with your web application.

Microdata − This lets you create your own vocabularies beyond HTML5 and extend your web pages with custom semantics.

Drag and drop − Drag and drop the items from one location to another location on the same webpage.

The DOCTYPE
DOCTYPEs in older versions of HTML were longer because the HTML language was SGML based and therefore required a reference to a DTD.

HTML 5 authors would use simple syntax to specify DOCTYPE as follows −

<!DOCTYPE html>
The above syntax is case-insensitive.

Character Encoding
HTML 5 authors can use simple syntax to specify Character Encoding as follows −

<meta charset = "UTF-8">
The above syntax is case-insensitive.

The <script> tag
It's common practice to add a type attribute with a value of "text/javascript" to script elements as follows −

<script type = "text/javascript" src = "scriptfile.js"></script> 
HTML 5 removes extra information required and you can use simply following syntax −

<script src = "scriptfile.js"></script>
The <link> tag
So far you were writing <link> as follows −

<link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "stylefile.css">
HTML 5 removes extra information required and you can simply use the following syntax −

<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "stylefile.css">
HTML5 Elements
HTML5 elements are marked up using start tags and end tags. Tags are delimited using angle brackets with the tag name in between.

The difference between start tags and end tags is that the latter includes a slash before the tag name.

Following is the example of an HTML5 element −

<p>...</p>
HTML5 tag names are case insensitive and may be written in all uppercase or mixed case, although the most common convention is to stick with lowercase.

Most of the elements contain some content like <p>...</p> contains a paragraph. Some elements, however, are forbidden from containing any content at all and these are known as void elements. For example, br, hr, link, meta, etc.
